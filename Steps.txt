<> STEPS <>
- DW AND DI PREPARATION. Are not relevant in our case.
1) INITIALIZATION PHASE
- Create the Data Warehouse (?)
2) HISTORICAL LOAD 
	2.1) Populate DW tables with data in Batch 1 (more info: clause 4.5)
	2.2) Execute the batch validation query (see below for more information)
	2.3) Print a message which states that the phase is finished
3) INCREMENTAL UPDATE (squared parenthesis: 2nd incremental update)
	3.1) Populate DW tables with data in Batch 2 [Batch 3] (more info: clause 4.6)
	3.2) Execute the batch validation query
	3.3) Print a message which states that the phase is finished
4) AUTOMATED AUDIT PHASE
	4.1) Execute the data visibility 1 query
	4.1) Load the audit data in the audit table (defined in clause 3.2.19).
             Note that the audit files have the header.
	4.2) Execute the audit query (contained in file: "tpcdi_audit.sql)

<> OTHER QUERIES <>
|
1) DATA VISIBILITY QUERIES (contained in files: "tpcdi_visibility_1.sql" and "tpcdi_visibility_2.sql")
-> They have to be executed regularly from the start of the Incremental Update 1 and ends to the conclusion of the Incremental Update 2 (see specific time requirements from 7.3.3 to 7.3.7)
-> Used to verify the visibility of the data written to the DW. It collects data which is stored in the DImessages table and will be examined in the Automated Audit Phase
|
2) BATCH VALIDATION QUERY (contained in file: "tpcdi_validation.sql")
-> Write 
-> Executed multiple times during the Benchmark Run (i.e. from initialisation phase to automated audit phase), but not specified in particular how frequently
